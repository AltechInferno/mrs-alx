![Alt text](/screenshots/Screenshot.png?raw=true "Recommendex")

Music streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music use recommender systems to suggest songs to users based on their music preferences. In this project, we aim to build a music recommender system that provides personalized song recommendations to users based on a set of 'liked' songs.
